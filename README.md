Procedure and Methods:
Data Preprocessing: Explore and Understand the Features: Load the California Housing Dataset We began by loading the California Housing dataset using the scikit-learn library. The dataset provides various features related to housing in California.

Dataset Exploration To gain insights into the dataset, we utilized key tools:

info(): This method provided a summary of the dataset, including the number of entries, data types, and any potential missing values. describe(): This descriptive statistics summary allowed us to understand the central tendencies and distributions of numerical features. Data Visualization To enhance our understanding of feature distributions, we employed data visualization libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn. Visualizations, including histograms and boxplots, provided a visual representation of the data distribution and helped identify potential outliers.

Handle Missing Values or Outliers: Missing Values Although the dataset did not contain missing values, we demonstrated the use of imputation or removal techniques if such values were present. Common methods include dropping rows with missing values or filling them using strategies like mean imputation.

Outliers Outliers were addressed using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. We visualized boxplots to identify potential outliers and removed them to enhance the robustness of our analysis.

Split the Dataset: We utilized the train_test_split function from scikit-learn to divide the dataset into training and testing sets. This step is crucial to assess model performance on unseen data.

Linear Regression: Implement Linear Regression Model: We implemented a Linear Regression model using the scikit-learn library. This straightforward model is suitable for regression tasks and provides interpretability.

Train the Model: The model was trained on the training set using the fit() method. During this phase, the model learned the relationships between input features and the target variable.

Make Predictions: Utilizing the trained Linear Regression model, we made predictions on the testing set. Predictions were obtained for the target variable, representing house prices.

Evaluate Performance: We evaluated the model's performance using standard regression metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): This metric quantifies the average squared difference between predicted and actual values. R2 Score: The R2 Score indicates the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model. Artificial Neural Network (ANN): Implement ANN Model: We opted for a deep learning framework, specifically TensorFlow or Keras, to implement an Artificial Neural Network. The ANN architecture was designed, considering input and output layers.

Train the ANN: The ANN was compiled with an appropriate optimizer, loss function, and metrics. Training involved exposing the model to the training set, enabling it to learn complex patterns and relationships.

Make Predictions: Predictions for house prices on the testing set were generated using the trained ANN model.

Evaluate Performance: Similar to Linear Regression, we assessed the ANN's performance using Mean Squared Error and R2 Score to facilitate a direct comparison.

Strengths and Weaknesses:
Linear Regression: Strengths: Simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness for linear relationships. Weaknesses: Limited expressiveness for complex patterns. Artificial Neural Network: Strengths: Capability to capture complex patterns and relationships. Weaknesses: Susceptibility to overfitting, requires more data, and involves tuning complexities.

Summary of Key Findings:
Model Performance:

Linear Regression: Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.3147 R2 Score: 0.6242 Artificial Neural Network (ANN): Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.3777 R2 Score: 0.5489 Model Comparison:

Linear Regression outperforms the Artificial Neural Network based on both Mean Squared Error and R2 Score. The Linear Regression model demonstrates better predictive performance for house prices in the California Housing dataset.

Insights: Linear Regression Advantages:

Linear Regression, a simple and interpretable model, performs well on this dataset. It suggests that the relationships between input features and house prices are adequately captured by a linear model. Challenges Encountered:

ANN Complexity:

The ANN's performance might be affected by its complexity. If the architecture is too complex for the dataset size, it can lead to overfitting. Adjustments in the neural network architecture and hyperparameters might be needed to improve performance. Data Size:

Deep learning models often require large amounts of data to generalize well. If the dataset is relatively small, it can impact the ANN's ability to learn complex patterns.

Overfitting:

Overfitting could be a challenge, especially if the ANN architecture is too complex. Consider incorporating regularization techniques. Training Duration:

The duration of training may impact the ANN's convergence. Experiment with the number of epochs and consider early stopping to prevent overfitting.

Conclusion: Based on the current findings, Linear Regression emerges as the more effective model for predicting house prices in the California Housing dataset. However, the challenges encountered with the ANN present opportunities for further refinement and exploration. The implementation process highlights the importance of understanding model complexity, tuning hyperparameters, and addressing potential issues like overfitting and data size. Continued experimentation and fine-tuning of the ANN architecture may lead to improved predictive performance.
